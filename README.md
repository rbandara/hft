# HFT Sample Projects

This repository contains sample projects in **Java**, **C++**, and **Rust** that demonstrate basic constructs and techniques commonly used in high-frequency trading (HFT) development.

## Structure

- `java/` — Sample Java projects (e.g., event-driven processing, Disruptor usage, order book updates)
- `c++/` — Sample C++ projects (e.g., lock-free data structures, atomic operations, cache-friendly design)
- `rust/` — Sample Rust projects (e.g., atomic counters, safe concurrency, efficient data handling)

Each folder includes simple, self-contained code examples to help developers understand the building blocks of HFT systems in each language.

## Getting Started

Browse each language folder for code samples, README files, and instructions.  
These examples are designed for developers interested in HFT and low-latency trading technology.
